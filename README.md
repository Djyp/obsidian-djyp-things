# Djyp's things on Obsidian

Here's a catalog of my tools, systems, templates and stuff that I use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Content Production Machine

It's a system te create notes in a project where you have to create content. It gives overviews of your projects.
Everything is described in a dedicated repository : https://github.com/Djyp/obsidian-templater-content-production-machine

## Compact Calendar

There's a type of year view you may need, showing a whole year.
